## Custom WordPress Plugin Development
WordPress is an open-source blogging and content management platform. It allows you to create and maintain everything from a small brochure site, a news or blog site, online store (eCommerce), corporate web presence or portfolio.

A WordPress plugin allows you to add additional functionality to your WordPress website such as embedding your Twitter feed to an online store or content database.

Do you have an idea for a website that cannot be accomplished with an existing WordPress plugin? Colette Snow Media can take your idea and develop it as a WordPress plugin. We value ease of use and accessibility, ensuring your website will be accessible to the widest audience.

## Design to WordPress Theme Conversion
Have you had a website design created by a graphics designer? Colette Snow Media can convert the design to a standards compliant and accessible WordPress theme with support for the latest features such as Widgets and Gutenberg, and if needed with plugins such as WooCommerce and bbPress so that your web presence is consistent.
