Today, I am excited to announce our first WordPress plugin release. This plugin is called Bulk User Management, and as the name suggests, it allows you to create, edit or delete many users at once. It can also export a copy of your users which you can use to edit and re-upload. or store as a backup.

The plugin currently works with CSV â€“ Comma Separated Value files. These files can be created or edited in your favourite text editor, or opened with or exported from popular spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets.

The plugin has many possible use cases such as:

* Import your mailing list and create WordPress accounts
* Export your WordPress users to your mailing list
* Move users between WordPress installations
* Edit your users in Microsoft Excel
* Backup your users

The plugin is free and it can be downloaded from our Products > Bulk User Management page.
